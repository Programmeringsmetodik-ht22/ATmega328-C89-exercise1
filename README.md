# ATmega328-C89-exercise1
C89 implementation for microcontroller ATmega328P - includes dynamic memory allocation, function like macros and vtables.

Objective:
a) Replace function like macros for the led array (in "led_array.h") with corresponding functions.

b) If you have time, replace all dynamically allocated objects with corresponding automatically allocated objects 
(including the led array functions, you should still be able to use all functions except push, pop, resize, new and delete).
